This project was a collaboration with EDF France, who provided the data.

The objective of our project is to utilize modern statistical tools to identify high-risk situations in nuclear plants and present a single graph summarizing the predictions and uncertainties.

This project provided me with an opportunity to learn how to implement a neural network and gain insights into various machine learning methods used in classification and regression. I implemented a neural network model to predict safety criteria values.

In the second phase, I focused on quantifying uncertainties. I studied Bayesian neural networks as one of the Bayesian approaches, and I implemented Conformal Prediction to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions.
