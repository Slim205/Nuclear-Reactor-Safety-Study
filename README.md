# Project Title: Predictive Modeling for Nuclear Plant Safety

## Introduction
This project aimed to use modern statistical tools to identify high-risk situations in nuclear plants, with collaboration from EDF France.

## Project Overview
The objective was to develop predictive models to identify potential safety concerns within nuclear plants, with a focus on utilizing machine learning techniques.

## Data Source
The data used in this project was provided by EDF France and included various parameters and measurements from nuclear plant operations.

## Results
- Successfully developed predictive models to identify high-risk situations.
- Implemented Bayesian methods to quantify prediction uncertainties.
- Generated visualizations summarizing predictions and uncertainties.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the application of machine learning and modern statistical techniques in nuclear plant safety analysis. Future work may involve refining the models and exploring additional data sources.
